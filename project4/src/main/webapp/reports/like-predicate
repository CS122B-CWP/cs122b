The like predicate in input work for movie title, not case sensitive.

Normal Search Type:
1.	We choose like method for sql such that the result will return all movies that contain input.

2.	A_Z: 	results contains strings that starts with 'A', another character, and end with 'Z'. 
			The number of '_' specify the number of characters between 'A' and 'Z'.
			(e.g. l_m)

This the powerful method implemented by rlike/REGEXP.

1.	^b				results start with 'b' or 'B'.
2.	om$				results end with 'om'.
3.	az				results contain 'az'.
