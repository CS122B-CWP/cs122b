We mainly follow the tutorial but combined some setting in link2.

We also add a webapp level connection pool for better load balance (that an web will not exceed a number of connections
see project5.jdbc.JDBCProperty and project5.jdbc.JDBCPool) and it initialized at the webapp startup.

The main connection pool features are as follows:
removeAbandoned:	true
removeAbandonedTimeout:	30
maxActive:	100
maxIdle:	30 
maxWait:	10000

Both the single and scale version of the project are enbaled with connection pool.

In scale version, load balancing is enabled.

The write request (shopping cart operations, checkout, dashapp/instert_star, dashapp/insert_movie) is only handled by master instance
which internal ip is (10.0.1.16).
